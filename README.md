PyThermoFlash is a comprehensive computational tool designed for engineers, researchers, and scientists working with thermodynamic systems. The package focuses on flash calculations - a fundamental procedure in process simulation that determines the equilibrium state of a mixture at specified conditions. PyThermoFlash implements various thermodynamic models to accurately predict phase behavior and properties of complex fluid systems.
