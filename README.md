PyThermoFlash is a comprehensive computational tool designed for engineers, researchers, and scientists working with thermodynamic systems. The package focuses on flash calculations - a fundamental procedure in process simulation that determines the equilibrium state of a mixture at specified conditions. PyThermoFlash implements various thermodynamic models to accurately predict phase behavior and properties of complex fluid systems.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Flash Calculations**:
  - PT-flash (pressure-temperature)
  - PH-flash (pressure-enthalpy)
  - PS-flash (pressure-entropy)
  - VT-flash (volume-temperature)

- **Thermodynamic Models**:
  - Activity coefficient models: NRTL, UNIQUAC, Wilson
  - Equation of State (EoS) models: Peng-Robinson, Soave-Redlich-Kwong, etc (soon).
